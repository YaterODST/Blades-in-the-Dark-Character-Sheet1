# Blades-in-the-Dark-Character-Sheet1
Simple character sheet modeled after official BITD sheet

A work in progress sheet for Roll20 for the Blades in the Dark system. 

I am attempting to keep this sheet simple, clean, and easy to use and read. Currently the sheet is organized into three tabs for the three main components of a BITD character sheet. If you encounter any issues, or have suggestions for improvment, feel free to message me on Roll20. My display name is YaterODST.
